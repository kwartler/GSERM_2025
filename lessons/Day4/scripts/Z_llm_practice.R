#' Using an LLM explore and extract information from real airbnb reviews.


# Possible Ideas
# Sentiment analysis of each review
# Extract attributes and then apply sentiment analysis to understand what drives the sentiment
# Keep track of the neighborhoods to see if one neighborhood has better or worse sentiment

# Libraries

# Data
reviews <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwartler/teaching-datasets/refs/heads/main/twoNeighborhoods_BOS_airbnb_reviews.csv')

# Write a system prompt
# Make a data packet
# Make a POST request

# See if you can perform your analysis on a single review first to make sure it works as intended

# You can write a loop to iterate through the documents and obtain all the results in another object.
